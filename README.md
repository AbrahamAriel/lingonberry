# Lingonberry
Lingonberry is a clean and simple theme for bloggers, with responsive design and beautiful typography.

Lingonberry is developed by Anders Norén. Ported to Bludit by Hakim Zulkufli.
# Keep it simple, stupid
Lingonberry’s got all the features you need, and none that you don’t. It’s designed to be easy to install, use and visit.
# Beautiful design
As the name implies, Lingonberry has a charming, simple and colorful visual style that is easy on the eyes (and on the loading times).
# Post format support
Lingonberry supports all post formats and provides unique styling for all of them. No matter what kind of content you want to publish, Lingonberry’s got your back.
# Present your media in style
Show off your pictures with the slideshow gallery, share your audio with the built-in audio player and embed videos from video sites or from the media gallery. Except not for Bludit, sorry.
# Responsive & retina
Responsive design and high-resolution assets means that Lingonberry will scale gracefully and look great on all devices – big and small, retina and non-retina.
